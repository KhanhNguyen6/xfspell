The second goal implies a major design choice: the actual logging is completely asynchronous. It means that writing messages to the appenders obviously occurs in a background thread, but also that *all formatting operations are delayed to be performed just before the appending*. **No formatting occurs in the calling thread**; the log data is merely mashalled to the background logging thread in the more efficient way possible.

This post describes several [d3 quantitative scales](d3 wiki) - linear, quantize, quantile and threshold - walking through how they work and the tradeoffs involved when using them to display colors.	This post describes several [d3 quantitative scales](d3 wiki) - linear, quantize, quantile and threshold - walking through how they work and the trade offs involved when using them to display colors.
While the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is easy to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. Here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. Visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values the represent.	While the quantize scale makes intuitive sense and is simple to implement, skewed data or outliers can totally alter the color scale. Here a few very large values stretch out the scale, compressing the rest of the values into one color bucket which results in a map with just two colors. Visual differences between lower values are erased and the two colors that remain don't intrinsically communicate anything about the proportions between the values they represent.
Here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. The first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. On the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each point is being determined by its rank, not value.	Here, there are 70 values and 5 colors so each bucket has 14 values in it. The first bucket has 14 lowest values which are colored the lightest shade of purple, the second contains the 15th through 29th lowest values and so one. On the scatter plot, the previously horizontal bars are now vertical as the colors of each place is determined by its rank, not value.
The Jenks natural breaks algorithm uses dynamic programing to find groupings of value so that the difference of values within a group in minimized. The breaks for our population of values are calculated and, after light manipulation, passed to domain of a threshold scale. Each break in the domain is matched with a color in the range; values are colored based on the largest break which they are small than. Like the quantize scale, the horizontal rectangles show where the breaks occur.

While this approach initially looks like it could have a worst case runtime of `O(n²)` - for every point we could end up iterating over the whole `topPoints` array - each point can only be removed the `topPoints` array once. Asymptotically most of the execution time will be spent sorting the array, making the algorithm `n log n`.

A set of points' [convex hull](http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/introduction.pdf) is the smallest convex polygon that covers every points. If we picture each point as a peg in a board, we could approximate the convex hull by stretching a rubber band around all of the points and then letting it pull itself taut against the outer points.

Unfortunately, computers don't typically come with rubber bands and peg boards so we'll need a different approach to programmatically find a set of points' convex hull.
Since each edge of the convex hull lies between two points from our set of points, we can find the convex hull by iterating over each each pair of points and checking to see if it lies on the hull. To check the number of points to the left and right (blue and red) of the line formed by they pair are counted. If all the points aren't on the same side, pair can't be an edge of a [convex](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Convex.html) shape.

Where feedforward and CNNs only work on fixed sized inputs and outputs, RNNs can process one vectors one after another thereby work on any shape of input and output.

A specific type of RNN that you'll see discussed is called the Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM). Bizarre, no? Is the memory short or the long? Anyway, this type of RNN was introduced by [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory) and does an even better job of remembering something from "further back in time" compared to vanilla RNNs.

If function composition doesn't scare you, then yes, I think so. I believe using higher-order component helpers leads to smaller, more focused components, and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations -- like `mapProps()` or `shouldUpdate()` -- that aren't inherently class-y.

I believe using higher-order component helpers leads to smaller, more focused components, and provides a better programming model than using classes for operations—like `mapProps()` or `shouldUpdate()`—that aren't inherently class-y.
That being said, any abstraction over an existing API is going to come with trade-offs. There is a performance overhead when introducing a new component to the tree. I suspect this cost is negligible compared to the gains achieved by blocking subtrees from re-rendering using `shouldComponentUpdate()` — which Recompose makes easy with its `shouldUpdate()` and `onlyUpdateForKeys()` helpers. In the future, I'll work on some benchmarks so we know what we're dealing with.	That being said, any abstraction over an existing API is going to come with trade-offs.

Assuming you are running actionhero across multiple machines, you will need to ensure that only one of your processes is actually scheduluing the jobs.

Sometimes a worker crashes is a severe way, and it doesn't get the time/chance to notifiy redis that it is leaving the pool (this happens all the time on PAAS providers like Heroku).

To aid you in these edge cases, `queue.cleanOldWorkers(age, callback) is available.
Because there are no 'heartbeats' in resque, it is imposable for the application to know if a worker has been working on a long job or it is dead. You are required to provide an "age" for how long a worker has been "working", and all those older than that age will be removed, and the job they are working on moved to the error queue (where you can then use queue.retryAndRemoveFailed) to re-enqueue the job.

The biggest problem is the rendundancy in our codebase, that makes difficult to keep this things in sync. To add new field to our entity, we have to jump through all the files - modify entity class, then modify part of the schema and then update the interface. The same goes with inputs or arguments, it's easy to forget to update one or make a mistake with the type. Also, what if we've made a typo in field name? The rename feature (F2) won't work correctly.

If Classical AI was about very smart researchers creating rules attempting to understand the world, Modern AI techniques focus on letting computers derive their own "rules" using lots and lots of data. Rather than explicilty telling a computer how to find a cat, we'll just show the computer lots of examples of cats, and see if the computer can construct a cat detector by figuring out what differentiates cats from dogs or muffins or couches or motorcycles.

Along the way, we're going to explore software that will help you understand if your customers are excited, sad or disgusted by your products. We'll see how simple API calls can identify what objects are in an image. We'll show how to build your own iPhone app that cal tell you whether what you're pointing your camera at is a business card.

The XDM abstract model for data inherits several properties from JSON and JSON Schema, including the its basic type system. One ramification of this is that objects in XDM are semantically equivalent to maps. In XDM, objects are defined as maps from a valid JSON-LD property (a full URI, a compact URI, they keyword `@id`, `@type`, etc) to any XDM-defined value.

Unfortunately while Amazon [tracks](http://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132058735/is-your-e-book-reading-up-on-you) your Kindle page turns, it doesn't allow you to see your own reading data.
There are a couple of existing workarounds, none of which really do what I was looking for. [David Shackefold](http://www.dshack.net/2014/11/04/tracking-reading-statistics-on-the-kindle/) points out that the "Kindle FreeTime" program for managing kid's screen displays some rudimentary tracking information. The stats only include cumulative progress and time read though and aren't exportable.	There are a couple of existing workarounds, none of which really do what I was looking for.

[Matthew Suozzo](https://github.com/msuozzo/Lector) wrote a scraper for Kindle Cloud Reader that can look up your currently reading progress for books purchased from Amazon. Since Cloud Reader doesn't support PDF or epub uploads and requires that your kindle be online to update reading progress, I decided not to use it.

Sadly, connecting to the internet clears the logs so I've only got a couple of days of logs. It looks like checking footnotes can mess up the position tracking, but hopefully in a few months I'll have enough data to make something interesting.

While not nearly as comprehensive, there is one source of historic data that the kindle doesn't clear: a record of word lookups. `system/vocabulary/vocab.db` contains the book, time and context of each word look up. Lots accidental long presses, but it is fun look to back and see what words I didn't know:	While not nearly as comprehensive, there is one source of historic data that the Kindle doesn't clear: a record of word lookups. `system/vocabulary/vocab.db` contains the book, time and context of each word look up.

This solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services. While it is (at least in theory) called a `smart DNS proxy`, the only `smart` bit is in the `zones.override` file, which tells the system which domains to proxy and which to pass through.

- Describe which component properties the attributes proxy the value to (e.g., `color` maps to `material.color`, meaning the `color` property of the [material component](../components/material.md)).	- Describe which component properties the attributes proxy the value to (e.g., `color` maps to `material.color`, meaning the `color` property of the [material component](../components/material.md))
A lot of the primitives represent geometric meshes (i.e., shapes with an apperance). Thus, many of them inherit the common [mesh attributes](./mesh-attributes.md). So while attributes such as `color` or `src` are not listed in the attributes table for primitives such as [`<a-box>`](./a-box.md) or [`<a-plane>`](./a-plane.md), they are there. Remember to refer to common mesh attributes table when noted.	A lot of the primitives represent geometric meshes (i.e., shapes with an appearance).

Project:M36 extends this transaction model with the "transaction graph". This feture can be adequately described as version control for transactions. In the legacy DBMS model, the transactions are added to a linear transaction stream where each client is contending over the "head" of the stream- the latest transactions. In the transaction graph model, clients can add named branches and add transactions to the branches, then merge changes back, if necessary.

Currently as a limitation of the browser, `<iframe>`s can not be displayed within A-Frame, used as a texture, or be mixed with WebGL or VR. While it is possible to [overlay an IFrame on top of the scene](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2013/04/30/closing-the-gap-between-html-and-webgl/), it won't display properly in stereoscopic mode (VR) with proper distortion, and it won't be properly shaded. There may be browser features in the future that will help enable this.

Note that the current `<a-curvedimage>` primitive implementation is a bit difficult to work with. Ensuring that the image is not distorted by stretching requires the developer to carefully set the radius, theta-length and height in relation to the source image aspect ration. Our intent is to dramatically simplify curved images in future versions of A-Frame, so that developers can simply provide an image, a length and a radius, and get back an undistorted image, perfectly fit to the cylinder surface.

We see that components make it very easy to compose entities with mixtures of behavior and functionality and everyone can write their own components to modify entities however they desire. For example, someone might write a `vibrate` component that makes the entity vibrate regardless of which kind of entity it is. Although it might seem verbose, it provides a core foundation for abstraction.

Coordinates are generally printed and spoken as latitude, then logitude ([lat,lon]). Geocoder respects this convention and always expects method arguments to be given in [lat,lon] order. However, MongoDB requires that coordinates be stored in [lon,lat] order as per the GeoJSON spec (http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#positions), so internally they are stored "backwards." However, this does not affect order of arguments to methods when using Mongoid or MongoMapper.	Coordinates are generally printed and spoken as latitude, then longitude ([lat,lon]).

However, in practice people prefer to express the update to look as similar to vanilla SGD or to the previous momentum update as possible. This is possible to achieve by manipulating the update above with a variable transform `x_head = x + mu * v`, and then expressing the update in terms of `x_ahead` instead of `x`. That is, the parameter vector we are actually storing is always the ahead version. The equations in terms of `x_ahead` (but renaming it back to `x`) then become:	However, in practice people prefer to express the update to look as similar to vanilla SGD or to the previous momentum update as possible.

**Practical issues: Numeric stability**. When you're writing code for computing the Softmax function in pratice, the intermediate terms \\(e^{f\_{y\_i}}\\) and \\(\sum\_j e^{f\_j}\\) may be very large due to the exponentials. Dividing large numbers can be numerically unstable, so it is important to use a normalization trick. Notice that if we multiply the top and bottom of the fraction by a constant \\(C\\) and push it into the sum, we get the following (mathematically equivalent) expression:	**Practical issues: Numeric stability**.

In addition to the motivation we provided above there are many desirable properties to including the regularization penalty, many of which we will come back to in later sections. For example, it turns out that including the L2 penalty leads to the appealing **max margin** property in SVMs (See [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes3.pdf) lecture notes for full details if you are interested).

- We discussed the tradeoffs between computing the **numerical** and **analytic** gradient. The numerical gradient is simple but it is approximate and expensive to compute. The analytic gradient is exact, fast to compute but more error-prone since it requires the derivation of the gradient with math. Hence, in practice we always use the analytic gradient and then perform a **gradient check**, in which its implementation is compared to to the numerical gradient.	- We discussed the tradeoffs between computing the **numerical** and **analytic** gradient.

Just before the end of this session participants are asked to add links to their completed binders in the HackMD file so that they can demonstrate them in the final session.
The last session of the day focuses on participants demonstrating their Binders. The easiest way to do this iss to have one laptop connected to the projector with the HackMD file open so that all Binders can be demonstrated without worrying about connectors or wasting time. These demonstrations frequently generate questions and give participants a chance to discuss what they found easy/hard about creating a Binder.

Pinning certificates and public keys both have the option of validating the certificate chain using the `validateCertificateChain` parameter. By setting this value to `true`, the full certificate chain will be evaluated in addition to performing a byte equality check against the pinned certficates or public keys.

The `AutoPurgingImageCache` in AlamofireImage fills the roll of that additional caching layer. It is an in-memory image cache used to store images up to a given memory capacity. When the memory capacity is reached, the image cache is sorted by last access date, then the oldest image is continuously purged until the preferred memory usage after purge is met. Each time an image is accessed through the cache, the internal access date of the image is updated.	The `AutoPurgingImageCache` in AlamofireImage fills the role of that additional caching layer.

Unfortunately other projects I am currently working on take priority for the time being. There are some architectural aspects about the Gummi codebase that make popular requests like improved project support difficult to implement properly without some mayor reform. I'd probably do a complete rewrite of Gummi in Python or Vala if I had unlimited time, but unfortunately our reality does not work that way ;) - That said, I'm hopeful that this move to Github will bring in new contributions.

One of the coolest project I worked on during my 3 years at Google was Google Expeditions, a virtual reality app that allows teachers to lead students on immersive virtual field trips around the world. I especially enjoyed working on the app's field trip selector screen, which renders a `SurfaceView` behind a beautifully designed card-based layout that allows the user to quickly switch between different VR experiences.

An example illustrating transition groups in action can be seen in **Video 2.1** above. During the enter transition, the user avatars shuffle into the screen independently of the others, whereas during the return transition the parent `ViewGroup` containing the user avatars is animated as together one. The Google Play Games app likely uses a transition group to achieve this effect, making it look as if the current scene splits in half when the user returns to the previous activity.

Starting with Lollipop, `Transition`s can be used to animate animate `Activity`s. Before we get into the details of these new APIs, it will be helpful to discuss some of the common terminology used in the rest of this post. Let `A` and `B` be activities. If activity `A` starts activity `B`, then we refer to `A` as the _calling Activity_ (the activity transition that initiated the transition by "calling" `startActivity()`) and `B` as the _called Activity_.

Fundamentally the best way to deal with merge conflicts is to, so far as is possible, **ensure they don't happen in the first place**. You can improve your odd on this by **keeping branches clean and focused on a single issue, and involving as few files as possible**. Before merging make sure you know what's in both branches, and if you are not the only one that has worked on the branches then **keep the lines of communication open** so you are all aware of what the others are doing.

With runC, Pouch creates common containers like other container engine does, for example docker.

Pouch is always active on supporting Kubernetes since the first day when it is designed. We illustrate this part on the top half of the archtecture picture. First, Pouch will integrate cri-containerd inside, so Kubernetes can easily dominate Pouch to manage Pod. The workflow will pass cri-containerd, containerd client, containerd, runC/runV and pod. When configuring network of Pod, cri-containerd will take advantanges of network plugins which implement CNI interface.

First, Pouch will integrate cri-containerd inside, so Kubernetes can easily dominate Pouch to manage Pod. The workflow will pass cri-containerd, containerd client, containerd, runC/runV and pod. When configuring network of Pod, cri-containerd will take advantage of network plugins which implement CNI interface.
We support not only Pod in Kubernetes cluster, but also simple container management for users. This is especially useful for developers. In anonther word, Pouch supports single container API. In this way, workflow passes pouchd, containerd client, containerd, runC/runV and container. On the aspect of network, Pouch uses libnetwork to construct container's network. What's more, lxcfs is also used to guarantee the isolation between containers and between containers and host.

The primary way an application interacts with the event reactor is to schedule events for execution and then simply let the program run. Once `Loop::run()` is invoked the event loop will run indefinitely until there are no watchable timer events, IO streams or signals remaining to watch. Long-running programs generally execute entirely inside the confines of a single `Amp\Loop::run()` call.

Long-running programs generally execute entirely inside the confines of a single `Loop::run()` call.
The event loop can be stopped at any time while running. When `Amp\Loop::stop()` is invoked the event loop will return control to the userland script at the end of the current tick of the event loop.

Amp uses a global accessor for the event loop as there's only event loop for each application. It doesn't make sense to have two loops running at the same time, as they would just have to schedule each other in a busy waiting manner to operate correctly.

This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new RDD. `reduce` is called on that RDD to find the largest line count. The arguments to `map` and `reduce` are Scala function literals (closures), and can use any language feature or Scala/Java library. For example, we can easily call functions declared elsewhere. We'll use `Math.max()` function to make this code easier to understand:	This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new RDD. `reduce` is called on that RDD to find the largest line count.

It may seem silly to use a Spark to explore and cache a 30-line text file. The interesting part is that these same functions can be used on very large data sets, even when they are striped across tens or hundreds of nodes. You can also do this interactively by connecting `spark-shell` to a cluster, as described in the [programming guide](scala-programming-guide.html#initializing-spark).

"You can index a grid in two ways, direct indexing on the grid or indexing on an attribute. Direct indexing on a grid can be more efficient as no data is retrieved until you actually requenst an attribute.

Making smarter guesses sooner involves much more subtlety, so that's where we'll be focusing the majority of our time in this lab.

Now here it’s getting interesting. The `HeroEditorComponent`defines a template with an input to change the name of the hero and a `cancel` and a `save` button. Remember that we said we want to have the flexibility to cancel our editing and restore the old value? This means we need to maintain two copies of our `Hero` that we want to edit. Thinking ahead this is a perfect use case to abstract it into it’s own generic service since we have probably more cases like this in our app.	Now here it’s getting interesting.

Our `HeroEditComponent` uses this services under the hood for it’s `hero` property.

Technically we could, but our component wouldn’t quite behave the way it is supposed to. Remember that each injector treats the services that it provides as singletons.

It is important to address why it is worth learning how to create serverless apps. There are a few reasons why serverless apps are favored over traditional server hosted apps:
The biggest benefit by far is that you only need to worry about your code and nothing else. And the low maintenance is a result of not having any servers to manage. You don't need to actively ensure that your server is running properly or that you have the right security updates on it. You deal with your own application code and nothing else.	The biggest benefit by far is that you only need to worry about your code and nothing else. The low maintenance is a result of not having any servers to manage. You don't need to actively ensure that your server is running properly, or that you have the right security updates on it. You deal with your own application code and nothing else.
The main reason it's cheaper to run serverless applications is that you are effectively only paying per request. So when your application is not being used, you are not being charged for it. Let's do a quick breakdown of what it would cost for us to run our note taking application. We'll assume that we have 1000 daily active users making 20 requests per day to our API and storing around 10MB of files on S3. Here is a very rough calculation of our costs.

Using an example of JMS Clients, the messages sent by a JMS queue producer will be routed using the anycast routing type. Messages sent by a JMS topic producer will use the multicast routing type. In addition when a JMS topic consumer attaches it will be attached to it’s own subscription queue. JMS queue consumer will be attached to the anycast queue.

This component creates a `Switch` component from the React-Router that renders the first matching route that is defined within it.
